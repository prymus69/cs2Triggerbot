# What is this?
I made a simple trigger bot for CS2, that is undetectable because it's external which means it doesnt require any injector etc. it just changes your mouse input.

# Installation Guide 
You can either download this file by downloading pre build executables from releases tab or use command prompt for this.
## 1 Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prymus69/cs2Triggerbot.git
cd cs2Triggerbot
```
## 2 Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 3 Run The Script
```bash
python main.py
```

# Option 2
Alternatively, download ready-to-use executable file from [Releases](https://github.com/prymus69/cs2Triggerbot/releases/tag/1.0.0) page. Download executable and run it directly.

### Usage
This triggerbot isnt so comlicated, it doesnt require you to go around and configure "config.json" files which can get very annoying over time.
-**Open Game**
-**Start the round**
-**Use shift to enable is passively**
**Note: when you try using shift with triggerbot turned on while not being in game it will crash.**
